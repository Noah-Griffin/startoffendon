              Start Off End On is the first joint exhibition by artists Io Harrington and Noah Griffin with photography work by Alice Bradley. In this exhibition, the artists explore the potentials of fiction and truth creation from differing fundamental standpoints. A friction is thus generated, prying open new gaps for discussion.<br><br>
              Through observation of similarities between myths, from cultures around the world, Harrington plays with the idea of archetype through the construction of worlds: “Myths are basic building blocks of the human experience. Myth seemed to me as a very relevant method of storytelling, stories ingrained into the psyche of most humans interconnecting cultures and societies”. The paintings and sculptures offer symbols up to the interpretation of the viewer, allowing for a construction or location of myth. Harrington explores the healing potentials of world-building, through dialogue between viewer and work.<br><br>

              Griffin’s work takes as a starting point the historical implications of signage, pre-literacy and pre-systemisation. Before shops and houses were numbered, pictorial signs allowed for identification by a largely illiterate public. Griffin explores the process through which these signs are translated to spoken language and the inscriptive potential to form minoritarian communities and understandings of the phantom spaces they describe. Start Off End On interweaves with his previous online piece titled ‘Endon’, questioning the linear format and spatial locations of the exhibition.<br><br>
              Bradley’s recent work has been centred around movement and fluidity, more specifically themes of water and repetition. In this work she focuses on how light is manipulated by water, capturing a chronological series of images reminiscent of Renaissance nude paintings. Alice has been experimenting with printing techniques outside of the traditional darkroom; the work in this show was shot on film and printed onto sketchbook paper.
